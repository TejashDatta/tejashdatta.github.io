          Data visualization calls to mind the old saying: “a picture is worth a thousand words.” Data visualization techniques exploit this fact: they are all about turning data into visual form by presenting data in pictorial or graphical format. This makes it easy for decision-makers to comprehend the information contained within vast amounts of data at a glance to understand and draw inferences from it. In the present paper the authors have presented techniques and approaches for how huge quantities of data can be represented visually. The authors have designed an intuitive interface to make it easier for an end user to plot data and interact with it. It also demonstrated how data presented visually can be used to draw meaningful inferences from datasets representing real-world scenarios.
